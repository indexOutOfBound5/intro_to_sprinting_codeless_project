Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And summer's lease hath all too short a date

Sometime to hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed

But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest
Nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade
When in internal lines, to time, thou growest

As long as Men can breath and eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee
